# Origin-Based Classification Philosophy

## Core Principle

**Sentiment is NOT the deciding factor for classification; Authenticity and Objectivity are.**

The system classifies reviews based on **ORIGIN** and **MOTIVATION**, not sentiment.

## Classification Logic

### 🛑 FRAUDULENT REVIEWS (FAKE)

Reviews whose origin or motivation is non-organic and deceptive. Classified as FAKE regardless of sentiment.

#### Origin/Motivation Triggers:
1. **Synthetic**: Generated by AI/LLM (detected by Model 2)
2. **Financial**: Paid, incentivized, or associated with compensation (detected by Model A - Fraud Detection)
3. **Automated**: Posted by bots or spam networks (detected by Model 1 + Patterns)
4. **Non-Objective**: Biased language patterns (detected by Model B - Bias Detection)

### ✅ AUTHENTIC REVIEWS (REAL)

Reviews that originate from genuine, subjective human experience. Classified as REAL regardless of sentiment.

#### Origin/Motivation Triggers:
1. **Organic**: Written by a human user based on actual experience
2. **Objective Opinion**: Expressing genuine, un-incentivized feedback
   - Can be highly positive (great experience)
   - Can be highly negative (terrible experience)
   - Can be neutral (mixed experience)

## Decision Priority

1. **Model 2 (AI Detector)**: Primary authority on human vs. AI origin
   - If `model2.real_score > 0.6`: Likely human-written → REAL
   - If `model2.fake_score > 0.4`: Likely AI-generated → FAKE

2. **Bias/Fraud Detection**: Overrides everything if detected
   - Fraud detected → FAKE (regardless of sentiment)
   - Bias detected → FAKE (regardless of sentiment)

3. **Suspicious Patterns**: Supporting evidence, not primary
   - Only used if Model 2 is uncertain
   - Detects generic AI patterns (not sentiment)

4. **Model 1 (Review Classifier)**: Secondary signal
   - Combined with Model 2 for ensemble decision

## Key Changes

### Removed Sentiment-Based Logic
- ❌ No longer assumes negative reviews are more authentic
- ❌ No longer penalizes positive reviews as suspicious
- ✅ Focuses on origin detection (human vs. AI vs. paid)

### Pattern Detection Focus
- Detects generic AI patterns (repetitive, lack of specifics)
- Detects excessive positivity ONLY if combined with AI indicators
- Does NOT penalize negative sentiment

### Model 2 Authority
- Model 2 (AI Detector) is the primary authority on origin
- If Model 2 says human-written, trust it (regardless of patterns)
- If Model 2 says AI-generated, classify as FAKE (regardless of sentiment)

## Examples

### Example 1: Negative Review - REAL
**Text**: "Terrible service. Waited 2 hours. Manager was rude. Never coming back."
- **Model 2**: `real_score = 0.85` (human-written)
- **Sentiment**: Negative
- **Classification**: ✅ REAL (authentic human experience, negative sentiment)

### Example 2: Negative Review - FAKE
**Text**: "This place is awful. Worst experience ever. Don't go there."
- **Model 2**: `fake_score = 0.65` (AI-generated)
- **Sentiment**: Negative
- **Classification**: 🛑 FAKE (AI-generated, regardless of negative sentiment)

### Example 3: Positive Review - REAL
**Text**: "Amazing experience! The staff was friendly, food was excellent, and the atmosphere was perfect. We'll definitely return."
- **Model 2**: `real_score = 0.80` (human-written)
- **Sentiment**: Positive
- **Classification**: ✅ REAL (authentic human experience, positive sentiment)

### Example 4: Positive Review - FAKE
**Text**: "Perfect! Amazing! Excellent! Highly recommend! Best ever!"
- **Model 2**: `fake_score = 0.55` (AI-generated)
- **Patterns**: Excessive positive, generic language
- **Sentiment**: Positive
- **Classification**: 🛑 FAKE (AI-generated, regardless of positive sentiment)

## Implementation

All classification logic in `ensemble_classifier.py` now:
- Prioritizes Model 2 (AI Detector) as authority on origin
- Uses reasoning that mentions "origin" not "sentiment"
- Trusts Model 2's human detection over pattern-based suspicions
- Applies Bias/Fraud detection as override (non-objective = FAKE)
